# Computer Science II: C++ Programming

The second in a sequence of courses for majors in Computer Science. Topics covered include: design and implementation of large-scale problems; abstract data types; data structures (files, sets, lists,stacks, queues, and trees); program verification and complexity; recursion; dynamic concepts(memory, scope, block structures); text processing; object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism, and an introduction to searching and sorting algorithms. This course will use the C++ programming language.
